# Experince and about project :

  > The Game has Simple Algorithm and Simple meaning. Student or The gyu should escape from Bees and I have included the Nut shotting function for deleting bees. Well I spent 3 days for this version of project and that was enough fun to play with python libraries. What can I say about this experience? Exactly that was fun to code but I have to note that functions with math is great power and tool of coders. I guess my first two projects were a bit borring and simple without the math library but now I think I have improved them.
